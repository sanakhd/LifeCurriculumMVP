Final turn should signal closure (actionable or decisive acceptance).\n- Every turn ends with ., ?, or !  No ellipses.\n\nSTYLE DO / DON'T\n- DO: Sound spontaneous; build naturally on what was just said.\n- DO: Use concrete, relatable examples instead of abstract jargon.\n- DON'T: Invent personal stories or fake experiences.\n- DON'T: Pad with generic summaries or phatic filler.\n\nOUTPUT EXACTLY THIS JSON:\n{\n  \"conversation_chunks\": [\n    {\"speaker\": \"Host A\", \"text\": \"Natural opening thought…\"},\n    {\"speaker\": \"Host B\", \"text\": \"Curious follow-up question…\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nInteraction Prompt:\nCreate ONE short next-step interaction that helps the user apply or check understanding of THIS conversation.\nReturn STRICT JSON ONLY.

Imagine a digital notebook that's shared among thousands. Each page is a 'block,' and they're linked chronologically.\nHost B: Why is the order of these blocks so crucial? Does reordering them make any difference?\nHost A: Order ensures a sequence of events, preventing double-spending. If someone tries to alter it, everyone has a record, maintaining integrity.\nHost B: What prevents a single entity from just changing all the copies?\nHost A: Here, consensus mechanisms like proof-of-work come in. They require significant computational effort to alter a block, making it practically impossible to change past transactions globally.\nHost B: Are there different consensus mechanisms, and do they affect security?\nHost A: Absolutely. Proof-of-stake, for instance, uses less energy but shifts power to those with more coins. Each has trade-offs in efficiency versus control.\nHost B: So, when evaluating cryptocurrencies, should the consensus mechanism be a primary factor to consider?\nHost A: Definitely. It's a key factor in understanding a cryptocurrency's potential security and scalability. One actionable insight: Always check the consensus mechanism when assessing a cryptocurrency.\nHost B: That's clear.
