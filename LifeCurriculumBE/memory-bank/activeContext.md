# LifeCurriculum Backend - Active Context

## Current Work Focus

### Primary Development Area
**5-Day Microlearning Program System**: Comprehensive program generation system that creates structured, context-aware learning programs with sophisticated prompting and persistent storage.

### Active Endpoints
- `POST /api/v1/generate-program`: Fully operational program generation endpoint
  - Input: Focus area, target outcome, and context (home/driving/workout)
  - Output: Complete program with title, description, and 5-day lesson outline
  - Storage: Programs persisted to JSONL file system
- `GET /api/v1/read-program`: Program retrieval by ID
- `POST /api/v1/generate-lesson`: Individual lesson content generation

### Architecture Evolution
**MAJOR SHIFT**: The system has evolved from basic curriculum generation to a sophisticated microlearning platform with:
1. **Context-Aware Programs**: Different learning approaches for home, driving, and workout contexts
2. **Structured 5-Day Programs**: Each program includes daily objectives, summaries, and context-specific practice goals
3. **File-Based Persistence**: JSONL storage system for program data
4. **Enhanced AI Prompting**: Sophisticated system prompts for high-quality, mentor-like content generation

## Recent Changes and Implementation

### Functional Components
1. **Program Generation System**: Complete workflow from user input to structured 5-day programs
2. **Program Storage**: File-based JSONL storage with CRUD operations
3. **Context-Aware Design**: Programs adapted for home, driving, and workout learning scenarios
4. **Enhanced Data Models**: Comprehensive Program model with focus areas, outcomes, and daily lesson structures
5. **Sophisticated Prompting**: Detailed system prompts for premium-quality educational content

### Current Implementation Status
- ✅ Complete Programs API with generation, storage, and retrieval
- ✅ Sophisticated AI integration with context-aware prompting
- ✅ File-based program persistence (JSONL format)
- ✅ Enhanced data models with enums and validation
- ✅ Context-specific practice goals for different learning environments
- ✅ JSON response parsing and error handling
- ✅ Program listing and retrieval capabilities
- ⚠️ MinIO DAO available but not actively used in current workflow
- ⚠️ Activities endpoints exist but are separate from main programs functionality

## Next Steps and Priorities

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Lesson Content Generation**: Enhance generate-lesson endpoint for detailed lesson content
2. **Program Progress Tracking**: Add completion status and progress tracking
3. **Enhanced Error Handling**: More robust JSON parsing and LLM response validation
4. **API Documentation**: Update OpenAPI documentation to reflect new program structure

### Short-term Enhancements
1. **Program Templates**: Pre-built program templates for common learning goals
2. **Batch Operations**: Generate multiple programs or lessons in batches
3. **Search and Filtering**: Search programs by focus area, context, or status
4. **Program Analytics**: Track program effectiveness and user engagement

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions
- **Console Output vs API Response**: Currently outputting to console for debugging, but should return in response
- **MinIO Integration**: Available but not yet utilized for curriculum storage
- **Session Management**: Basic session creation exists but no persistence layer
- **Response Format**: Using structured response models but curriculum content not included

### Architecture Considerations
- **Stateless vs Stateful**: Application is stateless but sessions could benefit from persistence
- **Storage Strategy**: MinIO ready for file storage, but need to decide on curriculum storage format
- **API Design**: Current design separates session creation acknowledgment from curriculum content

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Established Patterns
1. **DAO Pattern**: Clean abstraction for external services (OpenAI, MinIO)
2. **Manager Orchestration**: Business logic centralized in SessionManager
3. **Pydantic Validation**: All request/response models use Pydantic
4. **Async Throughout**: Consistent async/await usage
5. **Environment Configuration**: All settings via environment variables

### Code Organization Preferences
- Clear separation between API, Manager, and DAO layers
- Comprehensive logging at all levels
- Structured error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- Type hints throughout for better IDE support

## Current Learnings and Project Insights

### Working Well
1. **FastAPI Structure**: Clean, maintainable API organization
2. **OpenAI Integration**: Reliable curriculum generation with good quality output
3. **Configuration System**: Flexible environment-based configuration
4. **Error Handling**: Robust error management across all layers

### Areas for Improvement
1. **API Response Design**: Curriculum should be returned in API response
2. **Storage Utilization**: MinIO integration exists but isn't being used
3. **Session Tracking**: No persistence or retrieval mechanism for generated curricula
4. **Testing Coverage**: Limited test files present

### Key Technical Insights
- OpenAI API integration is stable and produces quality curricula
- FastAPI's automatic documentation is valuable for API consumers
- Pydantic validation catches issues early in the request pipeline
- The DAO pattern successfully abstracts external service complexity
- Console output is useful for development but not production-ready

## Environment Status
- **Virtual Environment**: `.venv` directory present
- **Configuration**: Using `.env.example` as template
- **Dependencies**: All required packages in requirements.txt
- **Demo Files**: Root-level demo files suggest recent testing activity
- **Git Integration**: Connected to PSSK-Projects/LifeCurriculumBE repository

## Current Challenges
1. **Curriculum Delivery**: Need to modify response to include generated content
2. **Storage Integration**: MinIO available but not connected to curriculum workflow
3. **Session Continuity**: No way to retrieve or track previous curricula
4. **Production Readiness**: Console output not suitable for production use
