## What's Left to Build (Development Pipeline)

### 🔄 Immediate Development Needs
1. **API Response Enhancement**
   - Modify SessionManager to return curriculum content
   - Update SetupLessonResponse model to include curriculum
   - Remove console-only output behavior

2. **Storage Integration**
   - Connect MinIO to curriculum storage workflow
   - Implement curriculum persistence (JSON/text format)
   - Add unique session/curriculum identification

3. **Session Management Enhancement**
   - Add session persistence layer
   - Implement session retrieval mechanisms
   - Create session status tracking

### 🔄 Feature Development Pipeline
1. **Curriculum Retrieval System**
   - `GET /api/v1/activities/curricula/{session_id}` endpoint
   - List all curricula endpoint
   - Search/filter capabilities

2. **Enhanced Activity Management**
   - Convert placeholder activity endpoints to functional
   - Add CRUD operations for learning activities
   - Implement activity-curriculum relationships

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Rate limiting for OpenAI API calls
   - Curriculum versioning and updates
   - Batch curriculum generation
   - Template-based curriculum generation

### 🔄 Production Readiness
1. **Testing Coverage**
   - Expand unit test coverage beyond basic structure
   - Integration tests for OpenAI and MinIO interactions
   - End-to-end API testing
   - Performance testing for concurrent requests

2. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - Structured logging enhancements
   - Metrics collection for API performance
   - External service health monitoring
   - Error tracking and alerting

## Current Status Assessment

### 🟢 Stable and Functional
- Core FastAPI application structure
- OpenAI integration and curriculum generation
- Basic API endpoints with proper validation
- Configuration and environment management
- Health monitoring capabilities

### 🟡 Partially Implemented
- **Curriculum Delivery**: Working but limited to console output
- **Storage System**: MinIO DAO exists but not integrated into workflow
- **Session Management**: Basic creation but no persistence or retrieval
- **Activity System**: Placeholder endpoints exist but not functional

### 🔴 Not Yet Implemented
- Curriculum content in API responses
- Persistent storage of generated curricula
- Session retrieval and management
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Production-ready error handling for all edge cases

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Technical Issues
1. **Curriculum Response Gap**: Generated curriculum not returned in API response
2. **Storage Disconnect**: MinIO available but not connected to main workflow
3. **Session Persistence**: No database or storage layer for session tracking
4. **Console Dependency**: Current implementation relies on console output

### Architecture Limitations
1. **Stateless Design**: Good for scalability but limits session continuity
2. **Single Response Model**: Current API design separates acknowledgment from content
3. **No Pagination**: Future curriculum listing will need pagination support
4. **Limited Error Context**: Some error responses could provide more debugging information

### Operational Constraints
1. **OpenAI Rate Limits**: No built-in rate limiting or queue management
2. **Memory Usage**: Large curriculum generation could impact memory
3. **Concurrent Request Handling**: No explicit concurrency controls
4. **Configuration Validation**: Runtime validation but no startup validation

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Design Decisions
- **FastAPI Selection**: Chosen for high performance and automatic documentation
- **DAO Pattern**: Implemented for clean external service abstraction
- **Async-First**: Consistent async/await usage throughout
- **Pydantic Validation**: Type-safe request/response handling

### Development Evolution
1. **Phase 1 - Foundation**: Basic FastAPI structure and health endpoints
2. **Phase 2 - AI Integration**: OpenAI DAO and curriculum generation capability
3. **Phase 3 - Storage Preparation**: MinIO DAO implementation (current)
4. **Phase 4 - Response Enhancement**: Need to return curriculum in API (next)

### Architecture Evolution
- **Started With**: Simple API structure with placeholder endpoints
- **Added**: External service integration with proper abstraction layers
- **Current Focus**: Bridging the gap between generation and delivery
- **Next Evolution**: Full session lifecycle management with persistence

### Decision Points and Rationales
1. **Console Output Decision**: Chosen for development/debugging but needs API integration
2. **MinIO Integration**: Prepared for file storage but not yet utilized
3. **Session Manager Pattern**: Centralized business logic for easier maintenance
4. **Structured Response Models**: Consistent API responses with proper validation

## Success Metrics Progress

### Technical Metrics Status
- ✅ API response times < 5 seconds for curriculum generation
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging coverage
- ⚠️ 99% uptime (not yet measured in production)
- ❌ Zero data loss (MinIO not yet integrated)

### Product Metrics Status
- ✅ Curriculum quality and coherence (based on OpenAI output)
- ⚠️ System scalability (architecture supports it, not tested under load)
- ❌ Integration ease (API incomplete without curriculum in response)
- ❌ User adoption (not yet deployed for user testing)

## Recent Accomplishments
