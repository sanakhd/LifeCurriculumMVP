# Life Curriculum - Active Context

## Current Work Focus

### Development Status
The application is in early-stage development with a functional MVP covering user onboarding and the main landing page. Based on the VSCode environment showing active development, the focus has been on perfecting the initial user experience and visual design.

### Recent Activity Observed
- Extensive CSS styling work (20+ HMR updates to App.css)
- Component refinements on LandingPage.tsx
- Development server running on port 5175 (previous ports 5173, 5174 were occupied)
- Active styling and layout improvements

### Current State Assessment
- **Onboarding Flow**: Complete and functional
- **User Persistence**: Cookie-based system working
- **Landing Page**: Rich, detailed UI with journey visualization
- **Styling**: Extensive custom CSS with animations and responsive design
- **Navigation**: Basic structure in place but not yet functional

## Next Steps and Priorities

### Immediate Development Path
1. **Program Creation Interface**: The "Create Your First Program" CTA needs implementation
2. **Navigation Functionality**: Dashboard, programs, progress navigation items need routes/pages
3. **Program Ideas Integration**: Make the suggested ideas clickable and actionable
4. **User Settings**: Implement user avatar functionality and preferences

### Technical Next Steps
1. **Routing Implementation**: Add React Router for multi-page navigation
2. **Program Data Structure**: Define TypeScript interfaces for programs and progress
3. **API Planning**: Prepare for backend integration for program content
4. **State Management Upgrade**: Consider Context API for program state

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Design System Patterns
- **Color Scheme**: Heavy use of gradients and modern UI patterns
- **Typography**: Hierarchical text styling with clear visual weight
- **Animation Strategy**: CSS transitions for smooth interactions
- **Layout Approach**: Flexbox and Grid for responsive design

### User Experience Philosophy
- **Minimal Friction**: Single name input for onboarding
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, add complexity gradually
- **Visual Storytelling**: Journey steps and progress visualization
- **Personal Connection**: User avatar with initials creates immediate ownership

### Technical Architecture Preferences
- **TypeScript First**: Strong typing for all interfaces and props
- **Functional Components**: Hooks-based approach throughout
- **Simple State**: Keep state management minimal until complexity demands otherwise
- **Custom CSS**: Maintain full control over styling instead of UI libraries

## Project Insights and Learnings

### What's Working Well
- **Onboarding Flow**: Simple, effective name capture with persistence
- **Visual Design**: Professional, modern aesthetic that conveys quality
- **Component Structure**: Clean separation of concerns between components
- **Development Experience**: Vite's HMR providing fast iteration cycles

### Current Limitations
- **Navigation**: Header navigation items are placeholder, not functional
- **Content Management**: Program ideas and content are hardcoded
- **User Management**: No user accounts, relying only on cookies
- **Scalability**: Single CSS file will become unwieldy as features grow

### Key Design Decisions Made
- **Cookie Persistence**: Simple, effective for current scope
- **Conditional Rendering**: Instead of routing for two-view app
- **Inline Utility Functions**: Cookie management directly in App.tsx
- **Component Props**: Clear, typed interfaces for all component communication

## Development Environment Context

### Current Setup
- Development server typically runs on port 5175
- Active hot module replacement for CSS and components
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint providing code quality checks

### Workflow Patterns
- Frequent CSS iterations suggest design-focused development phase
- Component structure is stable, focus on styling and UX
- Git repository active with recent commits
- VSCode with multiple relevant files open for context switching

## Immediate Concerns

### Technical Debt
- Single large CSS file needs organization
- Cookie utility functions should be extracted
- Component props interfaces could be more comprehensive
- No error handling for failed cookie operations

### UX Gaps
- Program creation flow is missing (critical next feature)
- Navigation items lead nowhere
- No user feedback for actions
- No loading states or error messages

### Performance Considerations
- CSS animations should be optimized for performance
- Component re-renders should be minimized as state grows
- Consider lazy loading for future program content
- Mobile performance should be tested and optimized
