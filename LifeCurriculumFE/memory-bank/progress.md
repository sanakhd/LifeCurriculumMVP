   - My Programs page  
   - Progress tracking page
   - Routing implementation

3. **Program Ideas Integration**: Static content needs interactivity
   - Clickable program suggestions
   - Quick-start program creation
   - Category-based program filtering

### Important Features üü°
4. **User Management Enhancement**
   - User profile/settings page
   - Name change functionality
   - Avatar customization options
   - Data export/import capabilities

5. **Program Data Structure**

   - Local storage for program progress
   - Program completion tracking
   - Progress visualization components

6. **AI Conversation System**
   - Daily lesson interface
   - Conversation flow logic
   - Progress tracking within programs
   - Completion celebrations

### Nice-to-Have Features üü¢
7. **Enhanced UX**
   - Loading states and error handling
   - Onboarding tutorials
   - Help documentation
   - Accessibility improvements

8. **Performance & Polish**
   - Code splitting and lazy loading
   - CSS optimization and organization
   - Mobile app considerations
   - SEO optimization

## Current Status Overview

### Development Phase: **Early MVP** 
- ‚úÖ User onboarding complete
- ‚úÖ Basic UI foundation established  
- üîÑ Core program functionality in progress
- ‚ùå Backend integration not started
- ‚ùå AI conversation system not implemented

### Technical Health: **Good**
- No critical bugs identified
- Development environment stable
- Code quality maintained
- Performance adequate for current scope

### User Experience: **Foundation Ready**
- Onboarding flow polished and functional
- Visual design professional and engaging
- Information architecture clear and logical
- Ready for next feature implementation

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Technical Issues
- **Single CSS File**: App.css growing large, needs modularization
- **Cookie Utilities**: Should be extracted from App.tsx into separate module
- **Error Handling**: No graceful fallbacks for failed operations
- **TypeScript Coverage**: Some areas could benefit from stronger typing

### UX Limitations  
- **Navigation Gaps**: Header navigation leads to dead ends
- **No Feedback**: Users don't receive confirmation for actions
- **Content Static**: Program ideas and content are hardcoded
- **No Help System**: No user guidance beyond initial onboarding

### Scalability Concerns
- **State Management**: Will need upgrade for complex program state
- **Component Organization**: Current structure won't scale to many features  
- **CSS Architecture**: Need systematic approach for larger design system
- **Data Persistence**: Local storage strategy needed for program data

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions (Still Valid)
- **TypeScript**: Excellent choice providing safety and developer experience
- **Vite**: Fast build tool perfect for development workflow
- **Functional Components**: Modern React patterns consistently applied
- **Cookie Persistence**: Simple, effective solution for current scope

### Evolving Decisions
- **Routing Strategy**: Started with conditional rendering, will need React Router soon
- **State Management**: Simple hooks sufficient now, Context API needed later
- **Styling Approach**: Custom CSS working but needs better organization
- **Component Structure**: Good foundation, needs feature-based organization

### Lessons Learned
- **Development Velocity**: Focus on styling/UX first created strong foundation
- **User Experience**: Simple onboarding flow proved effective for user adoption
- **Technical Architecture**: Starting simple allows for clean evolution
- **Design System**: Visual consistency from start pays dividends

## Next Sprint Recommendations

### Priority 1: Core Functionality
1. Implement program creation interface
2. Add React Router for navigation  
3. Create program data structure and storage
4. Build basic program selection flow

### Priority 2: User Experience
1. Make navigation functional with basic pages
2. Add loading states and error handling
3. Implement program ideas interaction
4. Create user feedback system

### Priority 3: Technical Health

2. Extract utility functions into services
3. Strengthen TypeScript interfaces
4. Add comprehensive error boundaries

## Success Metrics Tracking

### Current Baseline
- **User Onboarding**: 100% functional completion rate
- **Session Persistence**: Cookie system working reliably
